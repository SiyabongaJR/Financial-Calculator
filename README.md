Finance calculator

**Project Details**

This was my first **Capstone project**, on the first level of the **HyperionDev Software engineering Bootcamp**.
The purpose of the project was to design a financial calculator for a small financial company that will   provide the user with two different financial calculators in the initial menu.
* An Investment caclulator
* A home loan repayment calculator

**Functionaity**

The user will be presented with the aforementioned finance calculators.
After the user selects which calculator they want to use, they will be provided with appropriate options given the chosen finance calculator.
If the user selected an **Investement calculator**, the program will require the user to input:

* The amount of money to be invested
* the percentage value of the interest rate
* The number of years that they plan to invest for
* the type of interest, be it \"simple" or \"compound"

Depending on the interest chosen, the program will output the expected future value of the initial investment.

If the user selects the **Bond repayment calculator**
The user will be required to input:

* the present value of the house
* the interest rate
* the number of months they will take to repay the bond

The program will then output the monthly repayments to be expected to be paid by the user.

**Project usefulness**

The usefulness of the project is the simplicity of the menu and design of the program. It is an easy to use financial calculator that can help the user get complex calculations done in an efficient way.

**How to use my code**

* You have to clone this repo with all the necessary files associated with it.
* You will have to have a Python intepreter in your machine to run the code. You can get one at https://www.python.org/downloads/

**Who maintains the code and is a contributor**

I maintain the code and I am the contributor.
